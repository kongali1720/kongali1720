---> Why do you care?

<!--- A good setup should quickly establish our hero’s origins and affinities and create an authentic frame that will support the rest of the story:
Think back to your past, all the way to your childhood. Who were your heroes?
What did you enjoy doing? What were your passions, talents, and interests
When did you first think: “I’m going to be a software developer”?
Is there any moment in your past you would like to relive?
What turning points in your life stand out?

---> What are your strengths?

<!--- Think about the problems that only you can solve.
On what do teachers, teammates, or friends usually compliment you?
Remember that we tend to underestimate or minimize our strengths. The Reflected Best-Self Exercise (Roberts et al., 2005), created at the University of Michigan, helps you mitigate this. In essence, you ask 15–20 people close to you to write stories about you at your best, then analyze the feedback for strengths, weaknesses, enablers, and blockers. More on that here.

---> Act two: Where our hero grows and changes in response to conflicts and circumstances.

---> What did you do?

This is where, driven by ambition and passion, the hero sets about trying to resolve some big problems, encounters all sorts of adversity that he manages to overcome, and learns some valuable lessons.

    ---> Recall the significant professional choices you have made (majors, internships, certifications)?
    ---> Why did you make those choices? How did they play into your bigger plan?
    ---> What languages and what technologies have you been close to over the years?
    ---> What are the biggest challenges you’ve overcome in developing your coding craft?
    ---> What sort of projects have you completed? Communication or financial apps, ad-hoc plugins, e-commerce platforms? What’s your specialty? What industries do you know?
    ---> Think hard about your accomplishments. What effort made you most proud of yourself? Something that few of your peers have achieved in their work?
    
---> What praises did you get?

Don’t recite your job history, unless the names of the companies in your past are internationally recognized and appreciated. Instead, focus on the industries you’ve developed solutions for, the skills you’ve mastered, and the most formidable obstacles you’ve knocked down.
What valuable insights/strengths/skills have you gained along the way?
